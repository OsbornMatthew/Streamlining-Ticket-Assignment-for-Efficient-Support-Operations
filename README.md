# Streamlining Ticket Assignment for Efficient Support Operations

This project aims to automate the ticket assignment process in ServiceNow for ABC Corporation's support team. By leveraging ServiceNow’s Flow Designer, ACLs, and custom tables, the solution reduces manual intervention, minimizes delays in support resolution, and improves overall efficiency.

## Objective

To implement an automated system in ServiceNow that:
- Automatically assigns tickets to the appropriate support team based on the issue type.
- Ensures secure and structured access to ticket data using roles and ACLs.
- Enhances response time and resource utilization in IT support operations.

---

## Features

- Creation of users, groups, and roles in ServiceNow
- Custom table setup (`Operations Related`) for ticket management
- Predefined issue categories:  
  - Unable to login  
  - 404 error  
  - Regarding Certificates  
  - Regarding User Expired
- Flow Designer-based automation for ticket assignment
- Role-based access control using ACL
- Dashboard to visualize ticket distribution and team performance
